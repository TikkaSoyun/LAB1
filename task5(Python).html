['Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. Python is Multi-paradigm, object-oriented, procedural (imperative), functional, structured, reflective. Python was conceived in the late 1980s. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects). Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. Python developers strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names.']
